# First Prompt photos

Drop the conference photos you shared into this folder using these filenames so the deck can load
them:

```text
public/photos/first-prompt/
├── evolution.jpeg           # "Evolution of AI deployment" stage photo
├── waiting-latency.jpeg     # "Waiting kills the conversation" slide
├── gpt-5-thinking.jpeg      # benchmark slide + speaker
├── panel-borders.jpeg       # panel: "reality of borders"
├── panel-open-vs-closed.jpeg
├── stage-trio.jpeg
└── stage-wide.jpeg
```

Notes:
- The deck will still run without these files, but the image tiles will appear empty.
- Keep file sizes reasonable (web-optimized) for best performance.
